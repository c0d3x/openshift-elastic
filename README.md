# openshift-elastic
Simplified solution to get up and running with Elasticsearch and Kibana in OpenShift w/Kubernetes and persistent storage.

## Info
I created this repository to add updated YML templates for running Elasticsearch & Kibana in Openshift.

I will also document the issues that I run in to.

Will add support for Logstash in future.
